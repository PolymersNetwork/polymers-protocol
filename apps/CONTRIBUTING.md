## üõ† Development Guidelines

To ensure high-quality contributions, please adhere to the following standards:

### Code Style
- Use **TypeScript** for all code contributions.
- Follow the project's existing code structure and naming conventions.
- Adhere to **ESLint** and **Prettier** configurations for consistent formatting.
- Write modular, reusable code with clear comments for complex logic.

### Commit Messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages using the following format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short description>
  ```
  Example: `feat(wallet): add QR code generation for Solana Pay`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `style`.

### Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure tests pass before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- Aim for >80% test coverage in critical modules (e.g., `wallet`, `iot`, `llm`).

### Branching
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
  ```
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `fix/smartbin-telemetry`, `feat/nft-minting`.

---

## üì• Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Push your changes** to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request** on the main repository:
   - Use a clear title and description, referencing any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
   - Describe the changes, their purpose, and any testing performed.
3. **Code Review**:
   - Ensure your PR passes CI checks (linting, tests, etc.).
   - Address feedback from maintainers promptly.
4. **Merge**:
   - PRs require at least one maintainer approval.
   - Squash and merge is preferred to keep the commit history clean.
