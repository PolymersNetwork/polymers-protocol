1️⃣ Oracle Integrations (Real-Time CO₂e & Token Prices)

Objective: Feed real-time environmental and token data into token flows and ESG calculations.

Components & Flow:
	•	Data Sources: Pyth Network (Solana), Chainlink (cross-chain), internal emission factor database.
	•	Backend: Fastify/MCP API polls or subscribes to oracle feeds.
	•	Frontend: Dashboards (React Native / Next.js) consume validated metrics via Supabase subscriptions.
	•	Token Flow Impact: Real-time token issuance (PLY, CARB, EWASTE, HONEY, HNT) based on updated CO₂e metrics.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Create /lib/oracles.ts with Pyth + Chainlink SDKs.
	2.	Implement real-time subscription to emission factor updates.
	3.	Normalize and feed metrics into Supabase as esg_metrics table.
	4.	Trigger TokenFlowDemo.tsx updates using GSAP animations for smooth Bezier flows.

2️⃣ Expanded Leaderboard & NFT Evolution Animations

Objective: Gamify engagement and visualize NFT twin evolution on dashboards.

Components & Flow:
	•	NFT Twins: Metaplex cNFTs with staking and evolution levels.
	•	Leaderboard: Mobile/Web dashboards fetch user points from Supabase.
	•	Animations: GSAP for Bezier token flows, sparkline charts, and NFT scale/rotation effects.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Extend /lib/gamification.ts to track NFT evolution (e.g., level, growth, tier).
	2.	Create Leaderboard.tsx component pulling Supabase user points in real-time.
	3.	Apply GSAP timelines for:
	•	NFT scaling and glow animations on evolution.
	•	Token flows updating with leaderboard rank changes.
	4.	Ensure mobile/web dashboards reflect consistent UI/UX and Dark Mode colors (#1A3C34, #F4A261).

3️⃣ Compliance Dashboard with Risk Scoring & Audit History

Objective: Provide governance and ESG compliance visibility (GDPR, CSRD, TCFD, ISO 14064-1, ISO 31000, INC-5.2).

Components & Flow:
	•	Data Sources: Supabase audit logs, Fastify transaction logs, token/NFT actions, AI ESG metrics.
	•	Dashboard: Mobile & Web React components (ComplianceDashboard.tsx).
	•	Metrics:
	•	Governance score (0–100) based on audit log completeness.
	•	ESG risk scoring based on token issuance and CO₂e deviations.
	•	Historical trends visualized as charts.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Create compliance_metrics table in Supabase capturing:
	•	timestamp, metric_type, value, audit_source.
	2.	Build /apps/mobile/src/components/ComplianceDashboard.tsx:
	•	Line charts for historical ESG performance.
	•	Risk scoring widget with color-coded levels (green/yellow/red).
	•	Audit log table with filtering/searching.
	3.	Integrate Sentry for error monitoring and anomaly detection.
	4.	Optional: GSAP or React Spring for animated metric changes and alerts.
